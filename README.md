This is a spike for a lean ops4j infrastructure powered by github.
Here we are playing with the Issue Tracker, possibly its Wiki, list Pros & cons and maybe even consider Jekyll+Github Pages as project pages.

Its a playing ground. Project related and serious project work is still done on issues.ops4j.org and www.ops4j.org though.
